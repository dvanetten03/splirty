      The Malinois was bred basically around the city of Milines from whence the name is derived. The Belgian Malinois was officially recognized by the AKC in 1959 and is the 59th most popular dog in the world.  They are high-energy workers who demand plenty of exercise.  They have 5 different colors and 1 marking.  They are confident, smart, hardworking and steadfastly loyal.  <a href="http://www.malinoisrescue.org/">Malinois Rescue</a>
